## Publish

1. Copy these files to the repository root and push.
2. Regenerate the exposed Twelve Data key, then add the new key in GitHub Actions secrets as `TWELVE_DATA_API_KEY`.
3. Run the `Update live economic calendar` workflow once.
4. Enable GitHub Pages from `main` and `/ (root)`.

The calendar uses Forex Factory's free public weekly export for the event list and TradingView's free economic calendar only to backfill released `Actual` values; no calendar key is required. The workflow merges each refresh into the current month and updates XAU/USD, live forex quotes and index snapshots every 15 minutes. All displayed times use Waktu Indonesia Tengah (`Asia/Makassar`, UTC+8). Never put the private API key in public HTML. LONG/SHORT is scenario analysis, not a prediction.

## Forex majors, JPY crosses & indices pre-news BUY/SELL

The terminal has an always-visible **Forex Majors & JPY Crosses** board for EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CHF, AUD/USD, USD/CAD, NZD/USD, GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY under the gold/crypto boards. Before each medium/high-impact release it shows an explicit **BUY · MARKET** or **SELL · MARKET** entry with Entry/SL/TP (30/60 pips, 1:2 RR). The direction comes from the event's Forecast vs Previous using the same economic mapping as the gold bias:

- Higher US inflation/payrolls → USD stronger → SELL EUR/USD, GBP/USD, AUD/USD; BUY USD/JPY, USD/CHF, USD/CAD.
- Higher non-US inflation/employment → that currency stronger → BUY its XXX/USD pair; SELL its USD/XXX pair.
- Higher US jobless claims/unemployment → USD weaker → BUY XXX/USD; SELL USD/XXX.
- For crosses, the event currency decides the leg: GBP/JPY follows GBP news directly and JPY news inversely; EUR/JPY follows EUR directly and JPY inversely. A USD event is treated as risk-on/off.
- If Forecast equals Previous, the board borrows the nearest same-currency medium/high event within 6 hours; otherwise it shows **WAIT** with straddle levels.

### Arah pasca-rilis (post-news)

Forex Factory's free exports contain **no `actual` field at all** (verified in both the JSON and XML feeds), so a released event used to freeze on `WAIT 46% confidence` forever. Two steps fix that:

- **Actual backfill.** `scripts/fetch-calendar.mjs` also reads the public TradingView economic calendar (`https://economic-calendar.tradingview.com/events`, no API key, but it returns HTTP 403 unless `user-agent` + `origin` + `referer` are sent, and `country=` is ignored so rows are filtered by `currency`). Forex Factory remains the primary list: only an empty `Actual` is ever written, importance/times/titles stay from Forex Factory, and TradingView's own importance is ignored. Matching is minute-rounded with a 5-minute tolerance plus head-noun title agreement, so "Spanish Services PMI" lines up with "S&P Global Services PMI" but a Belgian print can never be written onto a Euro-area row. Scale is only applied when the shared reference value proves a 10^n factor (e.g. Austrian "Unemployed persons" 314.5 vs 306600), percent suffixes from Forex Factory are re-applied, and anything ambiguous or unscaled is refused instead of guessed. `calendar.json` is rewritten only when at least one value was filled, and any TradingView failure falls back silently to the old calendar so the 15-minute cron never breaks.
- **Price reaction.** Some series (all S&P Global PMIs) simply have no published actual anywhere. For those, direction is measured from the 270 Yahoo 1-minute bars already stored in `data/markets.json`: the last close at or before the release versus the last close 15–45 minutes after it, written to `data/reaction.json` for releases in the last 6 hours and held for at most 45 minutes in the browser.

Direction is then resolved as a ladder, and the label always names the basis actually used:

`Actual vs Forecast` → `Actual vs Previous` → `reaksi harga 1 menit pasca-rilis` → **`NO ACTUAL DATA`**.

A released event inside the 6-hour window keeps its slot on the pair board (badge `BUY/SELL · POST-NEWS` with `valid s/d <expiry>`), an unresolved one is shown as `NO ACTUAL DATA` instead of a synthetic percentage — the confidence meter prints `—` whenever there is no computed surprise. Own-event edge (Forecast vs Previous, or a real Actual) is allowed for **every** impact level including Forex Factory "Low"; only the neighbour-borrowing fallback in `preNewsBias()` and the gold/USD boards stay at importance 2+. Reaction and momentum directions are asset-relative (the pair's own price rose) and are therefore never re-mapped through `mapPairBias()`.

The **Nasdaq 100 & S&P 500** board (`NAS100`, `US500`) follows the same USD catalyst: BUY means risk-on/stronger index, SELL means risk-off/weaker index. Risk template is NAS100 1%/2% and US500 0.75%/1.5%. Prices come from Yahoo Finance via `data/indices.json` (refreshed by GitHub Actions), with a live CORS-proxy fallback in the browser.

### Sumber harga forex

`data/forex.json` is generated by `scripts/fetch-calendar.mjs` every 15 minutes through the public TradingView scanner:

- **Anchor:** `OANDA` live quotes for all nine pairs (not the old daily `open.er-api.com` rate). The board reads the direct pair price, so GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY no longer need to be reconstructed from two daily USD rates.
- **Cross-check:** Saxo, FOREX.com, Capital.com, Pepperstone, Vantage, FP Markets, Eightcap, BlackBull Markets, ThinkMarkets and Skilling. `crossCheckPct` is the maximum deviation from the OANDA anchor; it is normally below 0.05%.
- **GO Markets, FBS, CMC Markets:** their public websites do not expose a CORS-free quote endpoint, and their TradingView feeds are not available to anonymous scanners. The workflow still probes `GOMARKETS`, `CMCMARKETS` and `FBS`, records `ok`/`unavailable` in `providers`, and the UI labels the OANDA mid as a reference price, not a broker fill. Exact broker bid/ask comes from the local MT5 bridge below when that broker terminal is logged in.
- **Fallback:** if every live feed fails, the fetcher writes the daily er-api rate and labels it `er-api (daily fallback)` in the UI. This fallback is deliberately visible, not silent.

`data/forex.json` shape: `{ generatedAt, source, anchor, quotes: { "EUR/USD": { price, consensus, source, changePct, crossCheckPct, providers } }, rates, providers }`. `rates` is USD-base and kept for the pre-news snapshot store; `quotes` is the direct pair price used by the board.

### Harga pair live di browser (tanpa API key)

A static file can only be as fresh as the 15-minute cron, so the pair board no longer depends on it. `loadForexLive()` in `index.html` POSTs directly to `https://scanner.tradingview.com/forex/scan` from the browser every 20 seconds and rebuilds the same payload shape the workflow writes (OANDA anchor, broker median, `crossCheckPct`, provider status), so the prices, `BUY/SELL · MARKET` entries and SL/TP levels move tick-by-tick instead of freezing between cron runs.

- Free and keyless: the scanner returns `access-control-allow-origin` for the Pages origin. The request must stay a CORS *simple* request, so the body is sent as `content-type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8`; `application/json` would trigger a preflight, and TradingView only allows `Referer, Accept` there. `user-agent`, `origin` and `referer` are forbidden headers in `fetch` and are not used.
- Gold, crypto and the countdown were already live (`api.gold-api.com` 30 s, Binance, 1 s clock). The pair board is now the same.
- The arrow next to each price (`▲ 0.8 pip`) is the delta against the previous pull; it only appears when the quote actually moved, so a quiet market shows no arrow rather than a fake one.
- Fallback chain: scanner → `data/forex.json` → daily `er-api`. Every failure grows the backoff by 5 minutes up to 20 minutes so a blocked network does not hammer the endpoint, and the source line states which mode the board is in: `LIVE — scanner TradingView ditarik ulang tiap 20 detik` or `SNAPSHOT 15 MENIT — scanner live sedang tidak terjangkau`.

`data/markets.json` is the consolidated market snapshot consumed by the matching **SniperFXBTCETHXAU** board. It contains XAU/USD, BTC/USD, ETH/USD, the seven Sniper FX majors, GBP/JPY, EUR/JPY and the NAS100/US500 indices, plus their latest Yahoo Finance 1-minute history. Consumers must read this file instead of calling Binance/Deriv/OANDA directly when they want prices to match this terminal.

`data/crypto.json` is written as well for convenience: `{ generatedAt, source, pairs: { "BTC/USD": number, "ETH/USD": number } }`.

`data/reaction.json` is the post-release price reaction derived from those 1-minute bars: `{ generatedAt, events: { "<Date>|<Event>": { releasedAt, pairs: { "EUR/USD": { baseClose, lastClose, movePct, dir, minutes } } } } }`, keyed exactly like the pre-news store so the page can look it up with the same `Date|Event` key.

### Local MT5 broker bid/ask

GitHub Actions cannot reach your PC, so the exact broker quote is exported by `scripts/mt5_quotes.py` on the Windows machine where MT5 is open and logged in. It reads `symbol_info_tick()` for the nine pairs and writes `data/forex-broker.json`; it never writes login numbers, balance, equity or credentials.

    python scripts\mt5_quotes.py       :: export only
    publish-broker-quotes.bat          :: export + commit + push
    install-broker-quotes-task.bat     :: schedule the publisher every 15 minutes

The scheduled task is `aiterminaltrading-broker-quotes`; it runs only while the user is logged on and MT5 is open. Log: `bridge\broker-quotes.log`.

`data/forex-broker.json` is intentionally minimal. It shape is `{ generatedAt, source, broker: { id, name, accountType }, quotes: { "EUR/USD": { bid, ask, mid, spread, spreadPips, digits, symbol, brokerTime } }, providers }`. The public file does **not** contain login, balance, equity, password, server name or terminal installation. `brokerTime` is the broker server clock; UI freshness uses `generatedAt`. When the file is at most 30 minutes old, the board shows the broker bid/ask and uses **ask for BUY** / **bid for SELL**. Older quotes are shown as STALE and the OANDA mid is used instead.

### Local scheduled market-data refresh

The scheduled GitHub Actions workflow is the normal updater, but it can be idle or delayed. To keep the Sniper bridge from serving stale data while this Windows PC is on, run the local publisher:

    install-market-data-task.bat

This creates the scheduled task `aiterminaltrading-market-data`, which runs `publish-market-data.bat` every 15 minutes:

1. `node scripts/fetch-calendar.mjs`
2. stage only the generated market/calendar files
3. skip commit when nothing changed
4. commit, pull/rebase, and push the fresh data

Log: `bridge\market-data.log`. The task runs only while the user is logged on and the PC has internet access. It does not use broker credentials and does not place orders.


Event cards also show the pre-news market bias for affected forex majors, crosses and indices, and the card's signal badge changes from WAIT to BUY/SELL. This is an execution scenario, not a guarantee: wait for the release if the forecast edge is flat.

## Auto order grid (forex major)

`scripts/mt5_grid_hft.py` is a breakout-grid executor for EUR/USD, GBP/USD and USD/JPY: lot 0.01, grid/SL 15 pips, TP 30 pips (RR 1:2), breakeven at +1R, daily loss stop $5. News behaviour: entries are blocked ±30 minutes around impact>=2 events, and for 60 minutes after an impact>=3 event the grid/SL/TP are widened ×1.5. It is DRY-RUN by default (paper book); orders are only sent to a DEMO account with `--enable`.

    start-grid.bat                :: dry-run
    start-grid.bat --enable       :: kirim order ke akun DEMO

Do not run it at the same time as `start.bat` (news executor) on the same terminal. Logs: `bridge/grid_orders.csv`; state: `bridge/grid_state.json`. Parameters: `python scripts\mt5_grid_hft.py --help`.
